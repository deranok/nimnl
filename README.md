nimnl
===
A thin layer for wrapping netlink libraries and generic netlink families,
loosely inspired by libmnl for the Nim programming language.

The goal is to provide a small amount of code that will facilitate rapid 
creation of libraries for netlink and  generic netlink families.

It also contains a wrapper for linux/netlink.h

ğŸš§ This library is work in progress. ğŸš§
